# Automated-Attendance-Tracking-Syatem
STM32-based Attendance System
Developed an automated attendance system using STM32 and FreeRTOS, integrating PIR-based motion detection and RFID authentication for efficient entry/exit logging.

Implemented real-time data logging with RTC and SD card storage via SPI, ensuring accurate timestamping and CSV-based recordkeeping for daily attendance.

Designed and simulated the complete system in STM32CubeIDE and Proteus, utilizing FreeRTOS task scheduling with queues and notifications for optimized power and resource management.
